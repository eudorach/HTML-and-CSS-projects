		<summary>What makes you stressed?</summary>
		<p>What stresses me out the most is the patient population and how unreasonable they are. They refuse to listen to the medical advice given and are quick to complain when they don't hear what they want to hear or they are not treated like queens or kings. They do not deserve to be treated in such a way when they are so ridiculously entitled. The office is open from <time>0800</time> till <time>1630</time>. You can schedule for an appointment by calling the office during the weekdays <time datetime="2023-02-01 08:00">Mondays through Thursdays</time></p>
